60% of success in any project is a good start. And usually it's the most tricky part, right?
In this post I'll show step by step guide to setup Ruby on Rails Project, which gems to add and what it is essensial to know about Ruby on Rails.

# Why Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is an amazing batteries included framework with comprehensive ecosystem similar to Laravel. 
Because Ruby on Rails is ***opinionated*** framework, you will never struggle with choosing which gems to use, how to structure your project and so on.
The next significant difference is that Ruby on Rails is a ***monolith*** framework. It means that it has everything you need to build a web application.
It has a built-in ORM, routing, templating engine, authentication, authorization, mailers, background jobs. But it comes with a cost.
Ruby on Rails don't have type checking, so you should get familiar with ***duck typing ü¶Ü***. It is not as flexible as JS ecosystem.


There are things that I potentially love in RoR and why I think it's extremely smart framework:

1. It is **frontend focused**: RoR backend development is really streamlined, enabling developer to focus mostly on crafting user interfaces.
2. **Built in WebSockets support** via Action Cable, no setup required!
3. **Built in REST API support** via Active Model Serializers. 
4. **Convention over configuration** principle when you don't need to deside how to structure your project, where to put your files, how to name them.
This allows RoR to boilerplate code, quickly scaffold components that follows the most common patterns.
5. **Gems come with CLI installers** and generators and this is absolutely different experience from JS ecosystem. 
Instead of going to step by step guide on how to setup a new library, where you need to create new files, add configurations, import new dependences, setup depending libraries 
your gems come with the all necessary code that will be added to your project upon instllation.
To setup Ruby on Rails project you need to know which gems to use.

This was just a preambula and some observations. Now let's begin!

# Create new project

We are going to configure our new RoR project using the following gems:
- rubocop
- solargraph
- annotate
- erb-formatter

And I'll also share some additional gems and setup tricks:
- auth: authentication-zero
- social login: omniauth-google-oauth2
- credentials setup
- erb alternative: phlex
- database: litestack

Let's start with creating new project:

```bash
rails new -c tailwind [my-project] -d postgresql --skip-jbuilder
```

#### -c
I prefer to use Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework, so I add `-c tailwind` option to use it out of the box.
Ofc you can add Tailwind any time later, but this way you will have a designed UI from the very beginning.

#### -d
You can add PostgreSQL as a database as in example `-d postgresql`. However, I personally prefer to use SQLite3 for production and I will
explain the reason later when I will cover LiteStack. **SQlite3 database** is default database used when new Ruby on Rails application is created.
This can be changed with the -d or --database option with allowed values: `mysql`, `oracle`, `postgresql`, `sqlite3`, `frontbase`, `ibm_db`, `sqlserver`, `jdbcmysql`, `jdbcsqlite3`, `jdbcpostgresql`, `jdbc`.
We'll stick with default database.


`--skip-jbuilder` option will skip installation of Jbuilder gem. Jbuilder is a templating engine for JSON, which I personally don't use.

You can also check commands on RoR guides https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html or simply call  `rails new -h` to see all available options.

## Rubocop

Rubocop is a static code analyzer. It helps to keep your code clean and consistent.
Add [rubocop gem](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) by adding to the Gemfile to the **Development group**:
```ruby
gem 'rubocop', require: false
```

Add [rubocop-rails](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rails) to the Gemfile too: 
```ruby
gem 'rubocop-rails', require: false
```
After that run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

To activate rubocop create file named `.rubocop.yml` in the root folder and add this to the top: `require: rubocop-rails`.

For VSCode users install [Ruby LSP](marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=shopify.ruby-lsp) extension for VSCode to enable Rubocop integration.

## Solargraph

Solargraph is a language server for Ruby. It provides intellisense, code completion, documentation, and many other features.
By the analogy with Rubocop, add [solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) and [solargraph-rails](https://github.com/iftheshoefritz/solargraph-rails/) to your Gemfile to the **Development group**:

```ruby
gem 'solargraph', require: false
gem 'solargraph-rails', require: false
```

For VSCode users install [Ruby Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph) extension.
To activate extention run `solargraph config` to generate .solargraph.yml and add here the following lines to tell you IDE plugin to use solargraph-rails:

```yaml
plugins:
  - solargraph-rails
```

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

## Annotate

Annotate is amazingly helpful to make shemas of the existing models.
Add [Annotate (aka AnnotateModels)](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) to your Gemfile to the **Development group**:

```ruby
gem 'annotate'
```

Run this command to generate shemas for all models:

```bash
annotate --models
```

>Note‚ùóÔ∏è Annotate depends on solargraph and cannot work without it.

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

## Erb formatter
Erb formatter is a gem that helps to format your erb templates. 

Add erb-formatter to your Gemfile to the **Development group**:
```ruby
 gem 'erb-formatter', require: false
```

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
``` 

For VSCode users install this [Erb formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elia.erb-formatter) extension.
.erb format is a default templating engine in Ruby on Rails. If you just started with RoR 
I recommend to stick with erb, because it is a default templating engine and you will find more examples and tutorials on how to use it.
For more advanced users I recommend alternative called Phlex but we will talk about it later in this post.

This is all for the developer gems. Now let's talk about some additional gems and setup tricks.
