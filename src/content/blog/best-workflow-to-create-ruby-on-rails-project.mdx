60% of success in any project lies in a good start, and it's often the trickiest part, isn't it? 
In this post, I'll provide a step-by-step guide to setting up a Ruby on Rails project, including which gems to add and essential information to know about Ruby on Rails.
I decided to create this blog post because, while attempting to bootstrap my RoR project following other guides, I observed that many developers recommend outdated tools and a cumbersome setup process. 
I appreciate simplicity and prefer scaling my app gradually. 
I hope you find this guide helpful. Let's get started!
## Why Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is an amazing, "batteries included" framework with a comprehensive ecosystem, similar to Laravel. Due to its ***opinionated*** nature, 
you won't struggle with decisions like choosing gems or structuring your project.
A significant difference is that Ruby on Rails is a ***monolith*** 
framework, meaning it includes everything you need to build a web application. 
It boasts a built-in ORM, routing, templating engine, authentication, authorization, 
mailers, and background jobs. 
However, this convenience comes with a trade-off.
Ruby on Rails lacks type checking, 
so you'll need to acquaint yourself with ***duck typing ü¶Ü***. 
It's not as flexible as the JavaScript ecosystem.


There are things that I potentially love in RoR and why I think it's extremely smart framework:

1. **Frontend Focus**: RoR streamlines backend development, 
allowing developers to focus primarily on crafting user interfaces.

2. **Built-in WebSockets Support**: Action Cable provides seamless 
support for WebSockets without the need for additional setup.

3. **Built-in REST API Support**: Active Model Serializers facilitate 
built-in support for REST APIs.

4. **Convention over Configuration**: The framework follows the 
principle of letting conventions guide decisions, eliminating the need for developers to decide on project 
structure, file placement, and naming conventions. This allows RoR to quickly scaffold components following common patterns.

5. **CLI Installers for Gems**: Unlike the JS ecosystem, 
RoR gems come with CLI installers and generators. 
Instead of following a step-by-step guide for setting up a new library, 
dealing with file creation, configurations, importing dependencies, and setting up related libraries, 
RoR gems include all necessary code that integrates into your project upon installation. 
To set up a Ruby on Rails project, you simply need to know which gems to use.

This was just a preamble and some observations. Now, let's dive in!

## Create new project

We are going to configure our new RoR project using the following gems:
- rubocop
- solargraph
- annotate
- erb-formatter

And I'll also share some additional gems and setup tricks:
- auth: authentication-zero
- social login: omniauth-google-oauth2
- credentials setup
- erb alternative: phlex
- database: litestack

This post doesn't cover how to set up RoR in a Docker image. 
This is a topic for another post. You can find a dedicated article in the 
"Related Articles" section at the end of this post.

Let's start with creating new project:

```bash
rails new -c tailwind [my-project] -d postgresql --skip-jbuilder
```

#### -c
I prefer to use Tailwind CSS as a CSS framework, so I 
add the `-c tailwind` option to use it out of the box. 
Of course, you can add Tailwind at any time later, but this way, 
you will have a designed UI from the very beginning.

#### -d
You can add PostgreSQL as a database, as in the example `-d postgresql`. 
However, I personally prefer to use SQLite3 for production, 
and I will explain the reason later when I cover LiteStack. 
The **SQLite3 database** is the default database used when a new Ruby 
on Rails application is created. This can be changed using the `-d` 
or `--database` option with allowed values: `mysql`, `oracle`, 
`postgresql`, `sqlite3`, `frontbase`, `ibm_db`, `sqlserver`, 
`jdbcmysql`, `jdbcsqlite3`, `jdbcpostgresql`, `jdbc`. 
We'll stick with the default database.

The `--skip-jbuilder` option will skip the installation of the 
Jbuilder gem. Jbuilder is a templating engine for JSON, 
which I personally don't use.

You can also check commands on RoR guides at 
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html or simply call 
`rails new -h` to see all available options.
### Rubocop
RuboCop is a static code analyzer that helps to keep your code clean and consistent. 
Add the [RuboCop gem](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) by 
including it in the Gemfile within the **Development group**:
```ruby
gem 'rubocop', require: false
```

Add [rubocop-rails](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rails) to the Gemfile too: 
```ruby
gem 'rubocop-rails', require: false
```
After that run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

To activate RuboCop, create a file named `.rubocop.yml` in 
the root folder and add the following at the top: `require: rubocop-rails`.

Install the [Ruby LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=shopify.ruby-lsp) 
extension for VSCode to enable RuboCop integration. 
This is the only gem that highlights your Ruby code.

### Solargraph
Solargraph is a language server for Ruby, 
offering features such as intellisense, code completion, 
and documentation. 

Following the analogy with RuboCop, 
add [solargraph](https://github.com/castwide/solargraph) 
and [solargraph-rails](https://github.com/iftheshoefritz/solargraph-rails/) 
to your Gemfile within the **Development group**:
```ruby
gem 'solargraph', require: false
gem 'solargraph-rails', require: false
```

Install the [Ruby Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph) extension.

To activate the extension, run `solargraph config` to generate 
.solargraph.yml. Add the following lines to this file to instruct your 
IDE plugin to use solargraph-rails:
```yaml
plugins:
  - solargraph-rails
```

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

### Annotate

Annotate is incredibly helpful for generating schemas for existing models. 
Add [Annotate (aka AnnotateModels)](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) 
to your Gemfile within the **Development group**:
```ruby
gem 'annotate'
```

Run this command to generate shemas for all models:

```bash
annotate --models
```

>Note‚ùóÔ∏è Annotate depends on solargraph and cannot work without it.

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

### Erb formatter
Erb formatter is a gem that helps to format your erb templates. 

Add erb-formatter to your Gemfile to the **Development group**:
```ruby
 gem 'erb-formatter', require: false
```

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
``` 

Install the [Erb formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elia.erb-formatter) extension.

.erb format is the default templating engine in Ruby on Rails. 
If you've just started with RoR, I recommend sticking with erb because 
it's the default templating engine, and you'll find more examples and 
tutorials on how to use it. For more advanced users, I recommend an 
alternative called Phlex, but we will discuss it later in this post.

This concludes the section on developer gems. Now, 
let's delve into some additional gems and setup tricks.
## Setting up authentication

There are different approaches to authenticate users, with email login 
being the most common. Personally, I prefer Google or social login, 
especially for SaaS applications where preventing the exploitation of 
free trials is crucial. From my perspective, using Google login is not 
only convenient but also more secure.

A reasonable alternative could be a passwordless or "magic link" login, 
where no password is created, and a login link is sent to the email 
whenever authentication is needed. However, this approach is a bit more 
complex to implement. Personally, I stick to Google login.
### Authentication-zero

For this specific task, I use the 'authentication-zero' gem. It's a 
simple and lightweight gem that enables login with email, Google, 
Facebook, and various other methods. It serves as a good alternative 
to the Devise gem, which, in my opinion, appears a bit outdated.

Add [authentication-zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/authentication-zero) to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'authentication-zero'
```
Then run command in terminal to setup authentication-zero with [omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) gem: 


```ruby
rails g authentication --omniauthable
```

Now as we have authentication setup, we need to add Google login.
For this we need to add [omniauth-google-oauth2](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2)


```ruby
gem 'omniauth-google-oauth2'
```

Don't forget to run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

To set up Google login, we need to add credentials to our project. Below is how you can achieve this.

### Credentials setup

Credentials is a new way to store secrets in Ruby on Rails, and it 
offers a popular and convenient method that's already implemented in 
RoR using a master key.

Firstly, you need to run this command in the terminal if you use VSCode: 

```bash
EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

Your IDE will open a new document that looks like this:
![credentials in VSCode](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TQws4Jxo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rulutzf4q1snplq9gxgl.png "credentials in VSCode for RoR")

Instead of the AWS example, we will add our Google credentials.


```yml
google:
  client_id: dmsdjn294wkin46nlose343k676frfg56f3r5gv566n.apps.googleusercontent.com
  client_secret: GSOKSPX-mjnjhjbnHgvd54F-knh75gffh
```

Now let's open `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` and add this code:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use(OmniAuth::Builder) do
  provider :google_oauth2, Rails.application.credentials.dig(:google, :client_id), Rails.application.credentials.dig(:google, :client_secret)
end
```
We use the `dig` method to retrieve credentials from the credentials.yml.enc file, and using 'dig' is preferred over using the `[]` method.

Now, let's add the Google login button to our view. Add it to the 
`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` file:

```erb
<%= link_to "Sign in with Google", user_google_oauth2_omniauth_authorize_path, method: :post %>
```

If you open the routes.rb file, you'll see the following:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get  'sign_in', to: 'sessions#new'
  post 'sign_in', to: 'sessions#create'
  get  'sign_up', to: 'registrations#new'
  post 'sign_up', to: 'registrations#create'
  resources :sessions, only: [:index, :show, :destroy]
  resource  :password, only: [:edit, :update]
  namespace :sessions do
    resource :sudo, only: [:new, :create]
  end
  namespace :identity do
    resource :email,              only: [:edit, :update]
    resource :email_verification, only: [:edit, :create]
    resource :password_reset,     only: [:new, :edit, :create, :update]
  end
  namespace :two_factor_authentication do
    resource :challenge, only: [:new, :create]
    resource :totp,      only: [:new, :create]
  end
  get  '/auth/failure',            to: 'sessions/omniauth#failure'
  get  '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions/omniauth#create'
  post '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions/omniauth#create'
  #...
end

```
The above routes were added by Authentication Zero during the code 
generation step above.

Now, you are pretty much done with the setup. You can run your project 
and try to log in with Google.
## Run models generator

The first step that follows the setup is to generate models.

```bash
rails g model Comment commenter:string body:text article:references
```

To create scaffolds for CRUD tasks, use the following command, adding any necessary model names and attributes:
```bash
rails generate scaffold ModelName attribute1:type attribute2:type
```
For example, if you want to create a Post model with title as a string and content as text, you would run:
```bash
rails g scaffold Tasks text finished:boolean author:references
```

Note that text is equivalent to text:string since string is the default type if none is specified.

## Phlex

Phlex is an alternative to the erb templating engine. It is a bit more advanced and has 
more features than erb. While it serves as a good alternative, I recommend using it only if 
you are already familiar with erb and want to try something new.

The main reason I use Phlex is that it has a better syntax for loops and conditions. 
Phlex allows you to write pure Ruby code inside templates, which is not possible with erb.

For example, this is how you write a loop in erb:

```erb
<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
  <p><%= task.text %></p>
<% end %>
```

And this is how you write a loop in Phlex:

```ruby
@tasks.each do |task|
  p task.text
end
```

To add Phlex to your project add [phlex](https://www.phlex.fun/rails/) to Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'phlex'
```

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

Once the gem is installed, run the install generator.
  
  ```bash
  rails g phlex:install
  ```
Now, you can rename your `.html.erb` files to `.rb` files and use Phlex instead of erb. 
If you have .erb files in your project, you can use [https://phlexing.fun/](https://phlexing.fun/) to convert erb to rb or you can simply have both erb and rb files in your project.

## LiteStack

I'm using SQLite in production because my approach is to build Single-Machine Rails applications.
And LiteStack is a gem that allows to use SQLite in production. [Litestack](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack) consist of:
- [LiteDB](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#usage): an adapter for database
- [LiteCache](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#sequel): a caching library that uses SQLite as a backend
- [LiteCable](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#actioncable): SQLite as a Pub/Sub adapter for ActionCable
- [LiteJob](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#activeresourcecache): a background job processor for ActiveJob
- [LiteSearch](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#actioncable): a full-text search engine for LiteDB
- [LiteMetric](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#litemetric): a metrics collector for Rails
- [LiteBoard](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack?tab=readme-ov-file#liteboard): a simple web server that provides a web interface for the collected metrics


As you can see, LiteStack is a full-stack solution for SQLite in production. The point of using Litestack is that you can refuse from using any other tools like:
- Database Server (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Cache Server (e.g. Redis, Memcached)
- Job Processor (e.g. Sidekiq, Goodjob)
- Pubsub Server (e.g. Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Fulltext Search Server (e.g. Elasticsearch, Mielisearch)


To add **LiteStack** to your project add litestack to Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'litestack'
```

Run bundle command:

```bash
bundle
```

Then run generator to setup LiteStack:

```bash
rails g litestack:install
```

Also in database.yml file change adapter:

```yml
adapter: litedb
# normal sqlite3 configuration follows
```

And that's it! 

## Conclusion

In this post, I've guided you through setting up a Ruby on Rails project, 
highlighting the essential gems to add and key aspects to know about Ruby on Rails. 
I didn't cover Docker setup in this post, as they each warrant a 
separate discussion. However, the general idea is that with a clean setup, you can 
build robust applications with Ruby on Rails.
