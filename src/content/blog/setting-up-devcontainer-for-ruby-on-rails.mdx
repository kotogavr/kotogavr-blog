## Why to program in containers?
I think you know how painful and how many unnesasarry files and dependences are installed on your computer when you program on RoR.
This is so a problem that I even come across on paid services that claims to setup a Ruby in Rails project for you.
Hopefully, we have a solution for this problem, and it is actually called generally an isolated environment, or a container.
You may think that containers are only for production or that you are just a begginer and isolated invironment would make thing so 
difficult that you'd never find a documentation to make your code work in a container. No worries, I thought the same!

## Types of isolated environments
I think the most popular isolated environment is Docker, right? But it turns out that there are other solutions that are more lightweight, strightforward, not overengineered, and more user-friendly.
First of all let's understand that there are 2 types of isolated environments: virtual machines(VMs) and containers.
VMs are more like a computer inside a computer, and containers are more like a process inside a computer.
The main difference is that VMs have their own kernel, and containers share the kernel with the host machine.
This means that containers are more lightweight and faster than VMs.
VMs are used for running different operating systems on the same machine, and containers are used for running different processes on the same operating system.
So we won't talk about VMs here, indeed we will talk about containers.
